At this point You should have 500 leaks, 4 bytes each for a total of 2000 bytes 

 RE - malloc every pointer to a char. This should give you a total of 2000 leaks + 1000 leaks 

	pointer = originalpointer;
	for(i = 1; i <=10; i++)
	{
		*pointer = (void *) malloc(sizeof(int));
		pointer++;
	}
*/
	/* Final number of leaks = 1500, bytes = 3000 */
	//free(pointer); // This will cause your world to segfault because the pointer is now at the end of the malloc'd block
	//free(originalpointer);
	return 0;
